# led_pixels.py
#
# A simpler version of led_swarm.
# Requires a Raspberry pi with MAX7219 LED wired to GPIO contacts.
#
# This script applies brownian motion to element positions.
# Parameters are configurable in the block 'constants' below.
#
# See led_swarm.py for the more generic, and complex, script
# that is parameterized and uses brownian motion to vary element velocity.
